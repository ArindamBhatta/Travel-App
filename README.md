# Material Design's ColorScheme: -
1. Primary
> The "primary" color is the main brand color of your application.
> It's used prominently across the app, such as in app bars, buttons, and the main background elements.
> Example: A vibrant blue for a School app, representing the identity.
2. onPrimary
> The "onPrimary" color is used for any text, icons, or elements that appear on top of a primary-colored background.
> It ensures that these elements are readable.
> Typically, if primary is dark, onPrimary will be light (and vice versa).
3. PrimaryContainer
> The "primaryContainer" is a lighter or more subdued variation of the primary color, designed to be used as a background for components such as cards or containers.
> It provides a softer, less dominant use of the primary color.
> Example: If the primary color is a bold blue, primaryContainer might be a pale blue.
4. onPrimaryContainer
> The "onPrimaryContainer" color is used for content (like text or icons) placed on a primaryContainer background.
> Ensures good contrast and readability, just like onPrimary.
5. Surface
> The "surface" color is used for the background of components like cards, sheets, and menus.
> It's typically neutral, like white, gray, or a slightly tinted variant, depending on light/dark mode.
6. onSurface
> The "onSurface" color is used for text, icons, or elements that appear on a surface background.
> Designed to ensure readability, often a contrasting color to the surface.
